      <%= render 'faq_question',
        id: features_id,
        question: 'What features does the dashboard provide?' do
      %>
        <p>
          The dashboard has been built in collaboration with organisers from
          various CLPs, to try to surface the information they most need to help
          with GOTV on polling day, and that is not already handled by existing
          tools.
        </p>

        <p>
          It has the following main features:
        </p>

        <ol class="is-lower-roman">
          <li>
            An overview of everything in your constituency on polling day,
            including every polling station (or ballot box), polling district,
            and ward.
          </li>

          <li>
            Create your own committee rooms in the dashboard for each real
            committee room your GOTV campaign is operating, along with the
            polling districts each committee room is responsible for, giving
            you an overview of each of these.
          </li>

          <li>
            Track how many canvassers and cars are available to each of your
            committee rooms, allowing you to deploy these where they can be
            most effective, or transfer them to another committee room where
            they are needed more.
          </li>

          <li>
            Track how many lifts of Labour voters to the polls there are still
            to do in each polling district, helping you ensure all of these are
            made by the end of polling day.
          </li>

          <li>
            Using a mobile-friendly interface you can share with your polling
            agents, they can send the latest turnout figures for each ballot
            box on their rounds as they collect it; this frees up your time
            receiving and collating these figures and makes them instantly
            available in the dashboard.
          </li>

          <li>
            Summary statistics for turnout percentage and how many Labour
            voters are still estimated to be in each area are then generated
            from these polling agent turnout figures, helping you make
            decisions about where would be most effective to send canvassers.
          </li>

          <li>
            The polling district for each committee room with most estimated
            Labour votes left is then highlighted, as a good suggestion for
            where to canvas next (barring other insights or your own local
            knowledge, this is just a suggestion).
          </li>
        </ol>
      <% end %>

      <%= render 'faq_question',
        question: 'How does this fit into our existing GOTV workflow using WARP sheets?' do
      %>
        <p>
          The GOTV dashboard is designed to complement rather than replace your
          existing GOTV strategy, which most likely involves using WARP sheets.
          You should still continue canvassing with WARP sheets throughout the
          day, and the dashboard just provides another means of managing your
          overall campaigning and surfacing information to help you make
          decisions about where is best to canvas.
        </p>

        <p>
          We are also currently adding tracking of confirmed Labour voters, as
          determined from your WARP sheets, so these confirmed figures will
          also soon be able to be input into the dashboard, and will then be
          able to be used instead of the estimated figures for calculating
          summary statistics for each area. <em>This feature should be added by
          end of day Tuesday 10th December</em>.
        </p>
      <% end %>

      <%= render 'faq_question',
        question: "Why would I use this rather than the Labour Party's Turnout app?" do
      %>
        <p>
          The Labour Party's Turnout app allows you to have tellers sitting on
          polling stations to report back live information on who's voted, and
          who they voted for (if they'll tell you). This data can then be sent to
          and used by the Labour Party's Doorstep app to allow you to know which
          doors still need knocking to help get out voters, as well as being
          useful for voter id in future.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Campaign Lab GOTV Dashboard, meanwhile, allows your polling
          agents to report back live turnout figures from polling stations,
          which is a less labour-intensive process but does not give you the
          fine-grained detail of using tellers. It also provides several
         <%= link_to 'other features', "##{features_id}" %> as described above.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you think the GOTV Dashboard features sound useful for your own
          GOTV strategy, you should
          <%= link_to 'get in touch', "##{send_email_id}" %> and we can get you set up.
        </p>

        <p>
          Alternatively, if you will be using tellers and the Doorstep app, you
          should <%= link_to 'contact the Labour Party Campaign Technology',
            'https://labour.org.uk/members/activist-area/tools-for-activists/'
            %> team about how to use Turnout.
        </p>
      <% end %>

      <%= render 'faq_question',
        question: 'Is a work space on the dashboard secure?' do
      %>
        <p>
          For each dashboard work space, we generate a unique, secure URL using
          a combination of 4 random words. This allows you to easily access
          your work space just by visiting this URL, and to share it with
          anyone else by sending them this URL (or reading it out to them,
          since it just consists of 4 English words).
        </p>

        <p>
          So long as you only share this URL with people you trust, your work
          space and its data should be secure.
        </p>
      <% end %>

      <%= render 'faq_question',
        question: 'Can I try it out for myself?' do
      %>
        Yes! Just go <%= link_to 'here', start_path %> and use the
        <em>Redbridge</em> data set.
      <% end %>

      <%= render 'faq_question',
        question: 'What if I have questions or need help on or before polling day?' do
      %>
        <p>
          <em>Before polling day</em>, you'll be able to ask any questions you
          might have &mdash; via WhatsApp, email, phone, or video call &mdash;
          and we'll be as responsive as possible. We'll ensure you know how to
          use the dashboard and have everything ready to go for election day.
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>On polling day</em>, someone from Campaign Lab will be available
          via WhatsApp or phone the entire time the polls are open
          (7am&ndash;10pm) to answer any questions that might come up
          unexpectedly, and to help you out if you run into any issues with the
          dashboard.

        <ol class="is-lower-roman">
          <li>
            We'll add you to a WhatsApp group, which is the primary place you
            can ask any other questions you have.
          </li>

          <li>
            We'll send you a detailed document describing how to export and

            dashboard work space for your constituency.
          </li>

          <li>
            We'll offer you the chance to have a video demo, where we can guide
            you (and anyone else involved in your campaign) through how to use
            the dashboard, and you can also ask questions.
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              Once we receive your data files, we'll create a testing work
              space with your real data for you to use, and to allow you to
              train anyone who will be using the dashboard (such as your
              polling agents).

              On Wednesday 11th December, the day before polling day, if you

              work space containing these up-to-date figures for you to use on
              polling day.
            </p>

            <p>
              Alternatively we can generate your polling day work space using
