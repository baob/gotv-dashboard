  # pre-election Labour promises.

  # Assumes Labour voters vote at same rate as average voter, that pre-election
  # figures are roughly accurate, that Labour promises are roughly equal to
  # number who will actually vote Labour (else this is likely to be very
  # inaccurate, though I guess it should be inaccurate by same proportion for
  # every polling station) etc.
